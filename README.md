# ChemistryFeaturization.jl
![Run tests](https://github.com/aced-differentiate/ChemistryFeaturization.jl/workflows/Run%20tests/badge.svg)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/aced-differentiate/ChemistryFeaturization.jl/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/aced-differentiate/ChemistryFeaturization.jl)

Unified graph building and featurizing for Weave.jl, AtomicGraphNets.jl, and (maybe soon) more!

Documentation is starting to be built in the [wiki](https://github.com/aced-differentiate/ChemistryFeaturization.jl/wiki)!

This package is currently focused on bulk systems. For organic molecules, [MolecularGraph](https://github.com/mojaie/MolecularGraph.jl) is recommended.
PubChem stores many molecular features for the compounds they catalog, and their data can be accessed via [PubChemCrawler](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/PubChemCrawler.jl).

## Features

### Graph-building and featurization from CIF files
* Build graphs (as [SimpleWeightedGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/SimpleWeightedGraphs.jl)) from CIF files using [PyCall](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) to [pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org) functions
* Visualization using [GraphPlot](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphPlot.jl), check out the `visualize_graph` function in the `graph_functions.jl` file, you can make pretty pictures like these, whether the graph is simpler or more complicated (thickness of connections indicates weight of edge in graph (higher weights for nearer neighbors)):

(NB: this animation's syntax is slightly out of date, new one to come!)

* Flexible featurization (currently onehot-style) and decoding: choose features to include, level of discretization, etc., and directly decode feature vectors to check values:
```
julia> features = Symbol.(["Group", "Row", "Block", "Atomic mass", "Atomic radius", "X"])
6-element Array{Symbol,1}:
 :Group
 :Row
 :Block
 Symbol("Atomic mass")
 Symbol("Atomic radius")
 :X

julia> atom_feature_vecs, featurization = make_feature_vectors(features)
[ Info: 16 elements were dropped so that all features are defined.

julia> decode_feature_vector(atom_feature_vecs["Si"], featurization)
Dict{Symbol,Any} with 6 entries:
  Symbol("Atomic mass")   => (27.1071, 53.2064)
  Symbol("Atomic radius") => (0.955, 1.19)
  :Group                  => 14
  :Row                    => 3
  :Block                  => "p"
  :X                      => (1.684, 2.012)
```

### SMILES input
Sean to add...

## Requirements
* Julia 1.4+
* packages listed in `Project.toml`
* In addition, you will need your `PyCall` to have access to the `pymatgen` package, which can be added using `Conda.jl` as: `Conda.add("pymatgen"; channel="conda-forge")`, as well as the `rdkit` package (`Conda.add("rdkit"; channel="conda-forge")`)

## Future Plans:
* "hybrid" featurizations using features from multiple paradigms if available
* more input file formats? e.g. [SELFIES](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies)
