#= ATOMS OBJECTS

Should have a field called `elements` that is a list of strings of elemental symbols.

AtomGraph shouldn't have to change too much from its current incarnation. WeaveMol is 
not currently a thing that can be directly fed into a model, so that will have to get
updated. Both will need some way to specify which types of features can be attached 
to them, maybe this is a place for the holy trait design pattern?

#= FEATURE OBJECTS

I decided on an abstract type to allow the dispatch shown below in the "magical encoding"
and "magical decoding" bits.

Representative examples â€“ feature: feature object type, input to encoder, output of encoder:

block (s,p,d,f):            AtomFeature (contextual=false), String, Flux.OneHotMatrix 
electronegativity (binned): AtomFeature (contextual=false), Float32, Flux.OneHotMatrix
electronegativity (direct): AtomFeature (contextual=false), Float32, Vector{Float32}
oxidation state:            AtomFeature (contextual=true) Int, Vector{Float32}
distance between atoms:     PairFeat, Float32, Matrix{Float32}
bond type:                  PairFeat, String, Array{Float32,3}

(bond type is categorical and gets one-hot encoded, so the first two indices of the Matrix
should be atom indices and the third should be indexing into the one-hot vector, which should just contain all zeros if the two atoms are not bonded (or we add a bin to the one-hot encoding to indicate that)

All subtypes should define `encode_f` and `decode_f`

    f.decode_f(encoded_feature)
end

#= FEATURIZATION OBJECTS
All such objects should define at least one list of <:AbstractFeature objects and either work according to the generic featurize! defined herein or dispatch featurize! if customized behavior is needed.

# TODO: maybe add option to exclude field names from iteration over fzn?
# docstring
function featurize!(a::AbstractAtoms, fzn::AbstractFeaturization)
    # loop over fields in featurization, each one is a list of features
    # encode each feature in that list and assign the results to the
    # field of the same name in `a`
    for feats_list in fieldnames(fzn)
        encoded = reduce(vcat, map((x)->x(a), feats_list))
