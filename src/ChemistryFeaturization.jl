#= ATOMS OBJECTS

Should have a field called `elements` that is a list of strings of elemental symbols, as well as fields to store features and an associated featurization object.

AtomGraph shouldn't have to change too much from its current incarnation. WeaveMol is 
not currently a thing that can be directly fed into a model, so that will have to get
updated. Both will need some way to specify which types of features can be attached 
to them, maybe this is a place for the holy trait design pattern?

#= FEATURE OBJECTS

I decided on an abstract type to allow the dispatch shown below in the "magical encoding"
and "magical decoding" bits.

Representative examples â€“ feature: feature object type, input to encoder, output of encoder:

block (s,p,d,f):            ElementFeatureDescriptor, String, Flux.OneHotMatrix
electronegativity (binned): ElementFeatureDescriptor, Float32, Flux.OneHotMatrix
electronegativity (direct): ElementFeatureDescriptor, Float32, Vector{Float32}
oxidation state:            SpeciesFeatureDescriptor, Int, Vector{Float32}
distance between atoms:     PairFeat, Float32, Matrix{Float32}
bond type:                  PairFeat, String, Array{Float32,3}

(bond type is categorical and gets one-hot encoded, so the first two indices of the Matrix
should be atom indices and the third should be indexing into the one-hot vector, which should just contain all zeros if the two atoms are not bonded (or we add a bin to the one-hot encoding to indicate that)

All subtypes should have `encode_f` and `decode_f` fields

#= FEATURIZATION OBJECTS
All such objects should define at least one list of <: AbstractFeatureDescriptor objects and either work according to the generic featurize! defined herein or dispatch featurize! if customized behavior is needed. You should also dispatch the decode function, for which a generic implementation does not currently exist.
