    build_graph(file_path::String; use_voronoi::Bool, radius=8.0, max_num_nbr=12, dist_decay_func=inverse_square, normalize::Bool = true)

Build graph from a file storing a crystal structure (currently supports anything `ase.io.read` can read in).

Returns an [AtomGraph](@ref) object.

# Arguments
- `file_path`: path to the structure file
- `use_voronoi::bool`: if true, use Voronoi method for neighbor lists, if false use cutoff method
- `radius::Float=8.0`: cutoff radius for atoms to be considered neighbors (in angstroms)
- `max_num_nbr::Integer=12`: maximum number of neighbors to include (even if more fall within cutoff radius)
- `dist_decay_func`: function (e.g. inverse_square or exp_decay) to determine falloff of graph edge weights with neighbor distance
- `normalize`: normalize all edge weights such that the maximum value is 1.0

Note: The parameters `radius`, `max_num_nbr`, `dist_decay_func` are of any relevance only when `use_voronoi = false` (which by default, it is)

    build_graphs_batch(input_folder, featurization=AtomFeat[])

Function to build and, optionally, serialize to file a batch of input files, optionally featurizing them as well. Saved .jls files will have the same names as the .cif (or .traj, or .xyz, or ...) ones but with the extensions modified. The `id` field of the AtomGraph objects will be the filenames.

# Arguments
- `input_folder::String`: path to folder containing structure files
- `output_folder::String` (optional): path to folder where .jls files containing AtomGraph objects should be saved if desired (will be created if it doesn't exist already)

If you want to featurize the graphs, at least the vector of `AtomFeat` objects describing the featurization procedure is required, and optionally the Dict mapping from elemental symbols to feature vectors (if it is not provided, it will be generated).

Other optional keyword arguments are the optional arguments to `build_graph`: `use_voronoi`, `radius`, `max_num_nbr`, `dist_decay_func`, `normalize`
