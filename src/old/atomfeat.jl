"""
    AtomFeat

A type representing the encoding of an atomic feature. A vector of these specifies a
featurization scheme. A feature vector for a specific atom can be encoded and decoded
by concatenating together associated subvectors generated using this scheme.

Currently, it is assumed that the subvectors are generated via a one-hot encoding. In the
future, there may be flexibility on this point...

# Fields
- `name::Symbol`: the name of the feature
- `categorical::Bool`: whether it's a categorical feature (vs. continuous-valued)
- `num_bins::Integer`: length of associated subvector
- `logspaced::Bool`: whether the feature values are logarithmically spaced
- `vals::Vector`: list of values; length equal to `num_bins` for categorical, `num_bins`+1
  (specifying bin edges) for numerical
