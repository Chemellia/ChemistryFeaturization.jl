"""
    AtomGraph

A type representing an atomic structure as a graph (`gr`).

# Fields
- `graph::SimpleWeightedGraph{Int32,Float32}`: the graph representing the structure. See
  [`build_graph`](@ref) for more on generating the weights.
- `elements::Vector{String}`: list of elemental symbols corresponding to each node of the
  graph
- `lapl::Matrix{Float32}`: Normalized graph Laplacian matrix, stored to speed up
  convolution operations by avoiding recomputing it every pass.
- `features::Matrix{Float32}`: Feature matrix of size (# features, # nodes). AtomGraph can
  be initialized without defining this field, but if it is defined, the subsequent field must be also.
- `featurization::Vector{AtomFeat}`: Featurization scheme specification to maintain 
  "decodability" of features.
- `id::String`: Optional, an identifier, e.g. to correspond with tags/labels of an imported
  dataset.

adjacency matrix `adj`, along with, at minimum, the list of elemental symbols `el_list`
representing each node. Note that the object can be initialized without features, but if
features are provided, so too must be the featurization scheme, in order to maintain
"decodability" of features.

Add atomic features to an existing AtomGraph object. Can be done by (in decreasing order of
speed since more things have to be calculated; these bullet points correspond to the four
call signature options above):
- providing feature matrix `features` (size # features x # nodes) directly
- providing a dictionary of feature vectors (keys should be elemental symbols) and matrix
  will be built
- providing only a featurization scheme (list of AtomFeat objects), and vectors for each 
  element will be built and combined into a feature matrix
- Providing a list of feature names (and optionally specify binning and spacing for 
  continuous numerical features) and built-in data will be used to build featurization
  scheme, vectors, and matrix.

In every case, a featurization scheme (or ingredients to build it) must be provided to 
ensure decodability of features.
