# Atoms Objects

Atoms objects (terminology borrowed from [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)) store information about the structure of a molecule, crystal, etc. as well as, optionally, encoded features and the featurization used to encode them. The parent abstract type is `AbstractAtoms`.

## AtomGraph
The `AtomGraph` type is used to store atomic graph representations.
